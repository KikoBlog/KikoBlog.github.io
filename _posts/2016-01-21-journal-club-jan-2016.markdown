## Objective

To explore the relationship between differences in morphology of RGCs and certain electrophysiological phenomena that have been described.

## Main outcome

**Model prediction:** difference between ON and OFF ganglion cells due to the presence of low voltage activated calcium currents in OFF cells and a lack of them in ON cells.

**Model scope:** The model seems to most accurately predict experimental outcomes for cells that have a large soma to total surface area.
